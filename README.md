[00:14.45] She, queen of the kings
[00:15.74] Runnin' so fast, beatin' the wind
[00:17.91] Nothin' in this world can stop the spread of her wings
[00:21.53] She, queen of the kings
[00:23.06] Broken her cage, threw out the keys
[00:25.35] She will be the warrior of North and Southern seas
[00:50.35] 
[00:29.35] Got raven hair, it's dark as night
[00:33.10] Icy eyes, outta sight, outta sight
[00:36.56] Her heart, in spite, is warm and bright
[00:39.80] Her smile awakes the northern lights
[00:57.80] 
[00:42.89] Lookin' out, she calls
[00:48.06] Lai, da-da-di-dai-da
[00:50.28] Who will conquer all?

[01:48.93] 
[01:41.84] A firestone forged in flames
[01:46.20] Wildest card, run the game, run the game
[01:49.48] Can't stay the same in this world of change
[01:52.94] Don't fear the pain, just break the chain
[02:13.44] 
[01:55.99] Lookin' out, she calls
[02:01.03] Lai, da-da-di-dai-da
